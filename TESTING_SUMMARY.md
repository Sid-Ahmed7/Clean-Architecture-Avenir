# Testing Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the testing implementation for the Clean-Architecture-Avenir project. The testing framework has been set up to verify that all routes work as expected, with a focus on authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Files Created

1. **infrastructure/tests/api-tests.js**
   - A comprehensive test script that tests all API endpoints
   - Tests user registration, login, and access to protected routes with different user roles
   - Verifies that authorization middleware correctly restricts access based on user roles

2. **infrastructure/tests/run-tests.js**
   - A utility script that automatically starts the server, runs the tests, and shuts down the server
   - Handles server startup, test execution, and proper cleanup
   - Provides detailed logging of server and test output

3. **infrastructure/tests/README.md**
   - Documentation for the testing framework
   - Includes instructions for running tests, expected results, and troubleshooting tips
   - Provides examples for manual testing with curl

## Routes Tested

The testing framework covers the following routes:

### Public Routes
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout

### Protected Routes
- `GET /api/client/profile` - Client-only route (requires CLIENT role)
- `GET /api/director/dashboard` - Director-only route (requires BANK_MANAGER role)
- `GET /api/management/users` - Multi-role route (accessible by BANK_MANAGER and ADMIN roles)

## User Roles Tested

The tests verify access control for the following user roles:
- CLIENT
- BANK_MANAGER (Director)
- ADMIN

## How to Run the Tests

### Option 1: With Server Already Running
```bash
node infrastructure/tests/api-tests.js
```

### Option 2: Automatic Server Start and Test
```bash
node infrastructure/tests/run-tests.js
```

## Expected Results

The tests will output detailed information about each API call, including:
- Request status
- Response data
- Any errors encountered

Successful tests will show:
- Client users can access client profile but not director dashboard or management users
- Director users can access director dashboard and management users but not client profile
- Admin users can access management users but not client profile or director dashboard
- After logout, no protected endpoints are accessible

## Conclusion

The testing framework provides comprehensive coverage of the API's authentication and authorization mechanisms. By running these tests, you can verify that:

1. User registration and login work correctly
2. JWT tokens are properly generated and validated
3. Role-based access control is correctly implemented
4. Logout functionality properly invalidates sessions

This ensures that the security mechanisms in the application are functioning as expected.
